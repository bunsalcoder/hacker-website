			<p>The <a href = "#"><strong> White-HAT HACKER. </strong></a> A white hat is an ethical computer hacker, or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration testing and in other testing methodologies that ensures the security of an organization's information systems.<strong> Ethical Hacking </strong> is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Contrasted with black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat respectively. While a white hat hacker hacks under good intentions with permission, and a black hat hacker, most often unauthorized, has malicious intent, there is a third kind known as a grey hat hacker who hacks with good intentions but at times without permission. A white hat hacker — also referred to as a <strong> “good hacker” </strong> or an <strong> “ethical hacker” </strong> — is someone who exploits computer systems or networks to identify security flaws and make improvement recommendations.</p>

			<p>The<strong><a href = "#"> Black-HAT HACKER. </a></strong> A black hat hacker is a hacker who violates computer security for their personal profit or malice. Black-HAT HACKERS are the stereotypical illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal". Black hat hackers break into secure networks and systems with the motive of destroying, modifying, or stealing some sensitive data, or to make the networks unusable for authorized network users. Blackhat hackers, often known simply by the term blackhats (think cowboy movies), are the bad guys of the hacker world. Such hackers often have no particular care for the rule of law, the systems that they disrupt, or what ill effects that they cause. Blackhats are distinguished from whitehats, the good guys, who are often found working to foil the efforts of the blackhats, and grayhats, who ride the line between the two, often crossing from one side to the other. a hacker (= a person who gets into computer systems without permission) who does this for criminal or bad reasons: Black hats are highly motivated. Information security professionals are all too familiar with the work of black hat hackers. These individuals seek to gain unauthorized access to enterprises’ computer networks by exploiting security vulnerabilities – malicious activity which frequently threatens the personal and/or financial information of millions of customers.</p>

			<p>The<strong><a href = "#"> Blue-HAT HACKER. </a></strong> BlueHat (or Blue Hat or Blue-Hat) is a term used to refer to outside computer security consulting firms that are employed to bug test a system prior to its launch, looking for exploits so they can be closed. In particular, Microsoft uses the term to refer to the computer security professionals they invited to find the vulnerability of their products such as Windows. A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the "computer underground". Blue hat hackers are security professionals that work outside of the organization. Companies often invite them to test the new software and find security vulnerabilities before releasing it.</p>

		<p>Before jumping into the world of HACKING, I had always been in the realm of information security doing plenty of things from working on security systems to cybersecurity operations to becoming a security advisor to developers, solution architects and business owners. Over the past decade, I have also been growing interest in cloud computing and gradually turned from a cloud skeptic to an evangelist. It still fascinates me how it removes innovation barriers, reduces cost of failure and allows organizations to create more value more rapidly.</p>
